<h3> 1.1-1 </h3>

<p>
    Give a real-world example that requires sorting or 
    a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.
</p>

<b> My Answer: </b>

    Real world example that require sorting, could be a college 
    recrutation application. There are usually several recruitments. 
    Possibly future students have different amount of points 
    that determines their chances to be aceppted into particular 
    recruitment. Those students with highest amount of points 
    will be sorted and accepted with first recruitment, but others 
    can not be forgotten, thus by sorting students by amount of their 
    points every next recruitment can be simplified by accepting those
    students that are next in the list since we know it is sorted properly.

    Other than speed, what other measure of efficiency might
    one use in a real-world setting?
</p>

<b> My Answer: </b>

    Speed is not always the most important thing. We, as developers, 
    have to take care of space-complexity. If alghoritm is fast, 
    but consumes amount of space that is totally not worth it,
    I would definitely consider it as not the best alghoritm.

    Select a data structure that you have seen previously, 
    and discuss its strengths and limitations.
</p>

<b> My Answer </b>

    Previosuly I have seen a Hash Map. I think it is really great,
    but it can not be abused. It is extremely fast, when we want 
    to access one thing by its key value. For example, we can store 
    a note and access it by the name we gave it to. Although, It wouldn't
    so efficient if we'd like to use Hash Map to display all of ours notes 
    and make a possibility to add a new ones in a particular spot inside a map.

<p>
    How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman 
    problems given above similar? How are they different?
</p>

<b> My Answer: </b>

    Those 2 problems both uses a graph. The difference is that 
    in a shortest-path problem we only have to determine 
    only one route from one intersection to another, while 
    traveling-salesman requires to determine more than one route.  
    Salesman delivers goods to several addresses  all of them would 
    have to be in some kind of connected to avoid length conflicts
    between each other.

<h3> 1.1-5 </h3>

<p>
    Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. 
    Then come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” 
    the best is good enough.
</p>

<b> My Answer: </b>
    
    Real-world problem that came to my mind and would require 
    the best solution is an surgery-related mechanism that 
    basing on patient's blood pressure and others med-related factors,
    would extremely fast and precisely compute how much time do surgeons 
    have to perform a certain surgery. 

    Real-world problem that would require only aprroximately best 
    solution is mentioned before in the book - shortest path. 
    The goal is to get to a certain place, efficiency is not a must.
